-- hyprglaze in-compositor state watcher. Installed via `hyprctl eval` at
-- daemon startup and re-installed whenever Hyprland reloads its config
-- (the Lua state is recreated) or the heartbeat lapses.
--
-- Pushes compact events onto socket2 (`custom>>hg:...`) so the daemon
-- never has to poll `.socket.sock`:
--   hg:cur:<x>,<y>              cursor moved (floored layout coords)

--                               monitor's state changed. <mon> is the
--                               output name, <ox>/<oy> its layout origin,
--                               <wsid> its active workspace, then the
--                               window strip: that workspace's windows
--                               plus those on its nearest existing
--                               neighbor workspaces on the same monitor.
--                               Records joined by \30, fields by \31:

--                               \31 title \31 rel
--                               rel is -1 (previous), 0 (active) or 1
--                               (next); active records come first so the
--                               32-window cap favors them. wsid and the
--                               origin ride with the geometry so workspace

--                               can never tear apart.

-- One watcher serves every daemon: each filters for its own monitor, so
-- there is a single 16ms timer no matter how many instances run. Emitting
-- per monitor also keeps each socket2 line under the daemon's 8KiB line
-- buffer, which a combined all-monitors event would overrun.
--
-- Coordinates stay GLOBAL layout coords on the wire; the origin travels in
-- the header and the daemon rebases. That keeps the record format byte
-- identical to what `hyprctl clients -j` reports, which matters when
-- debugging by eye.
--
-- Class/title are stripped of control characters (so they can never
-- contain the separators or a newline) and truncated to 64 bytes.
-- Dispatcher objects must go through hl.dispatch(); calling the closure
-- directly is an error on 0.56.
