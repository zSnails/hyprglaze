# hyprglaze

A wallpaper daemon for Hyprland that renders GLSL shaders and modular effects on the background layer. The wallpaper knows what is happening above it: window geometry, focus, cursor position, and system audio all feed the shaders in real time.

## Features

- Renders behind all windows via wlr-layer-shell
- Shadertoy-compatible GLSL uniforms (iResolution, iTime, iMouse, iWindow)
- Passes every visible window to shaders with smooth position tracking and identity-based focus
- Receives compositor state as push events from a small Lua watcher installed inside Hyprland, so geometry stays live even mid-drag and nothing is ever polled
- Captures system audio through PipeWire/PulseAudio, auto-detecting the output monitor
- Ships 365 Gogh terminal color schemes as palette uniforms; sprites recolor to match the theme
- Loads pluggable effects, each with its own TOML config section
- Reloads config live via inotify, including switching effects on the fly
- Smooths cursor, geometry, and focus transitions independently of frame rate
- Simulates CPU particle physics with Verlet integration, tracer trails, window collision, and cursor repulsion
- Includes an animated desktop buddy, optionally driven by Claude Haiku on AWS Bedrock

## Effects

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `particles` | Verlet physics particles with tracer trails, window collision, focused window gravity |
| `windowglow` | Subtle accent glow around focused window, surface tint on unfocused |
| `cellbloom` | Voronoi cells shaped by window boundaries and cursor, animated drift points |
| `concentric` | SDF concentric rings radiating from window edges, cursor interaction |
| `fluid` | Metaball contour lines that merge organically around windows and cursor |
| `starfield` | Radial starfield with audio-reactive speed, per-band star colors, beat pulses |
| `visualizer` | Stereo waveform with Catmull-Rom interpolation, amplitude-driven palette colors |
| `milkdrop` | Feedback-loop visualizer with kaleidoscope, beat detection, FBO pipeline |
| `buddy` | Animated sprite character with procedural behaviors, palette-recolored |
| `ai-buddy` | AI-driven buddy with mood system, emote particles, window awareness, wall climbing |
| `glitch` | Audio-reactive glitch art with RGB split, block displacement, VHS wobble, scanlines |
| `tide` | Rising water line tied to wall-clock time, with teardrops and splash jets |
| `fire` | Flames rise from window top edges; moving windows leave a directional wake |
| `voltaic` | Lightning arcs between window borders, St. Elmo's fire on the focused frame, beat-driven discharges |
| `moire` | Wave-interference ripples from invisible bodies orbiting windows, gravitationally lensed, audio-reactive |
| `swarm` | Boid murmuration in pixel-block ink; a hawk dives on beats, silence settles the birds onto windows |
| `fable` | Claude's self-portrait: a coral starburst that attends the focused window, rides the audio bands, sheds thought-sparks |
| `ivy` | Bioluminescent vines climb window frames and screen edges, spread frame to frame, wilt in place when windows move |
| `weft` | Windows shine through a grainy diffraction weave; the audio waveform threads through the fringes |
| `whorl` | Cyclic cellular automaton on a phosphor CRT: two-tone spiral waves break around windows, music wired into the rules |

## Requirements

hyprglaze talks to Hyprland through its Lua config manager, which means Hyprland 0.55 or newer configured with `hyprland.lua` rather than the classic `hyprland.conf`. At startup the daemon installs a watcher into the compositor's Lua state; if your Hyprland runs a classic config, hyprglaze will refuse to start.

## Install (Arch Linux)

### From AUR

```
yay -S hyprglaze-git
```

### From source

```
sudo pacman -S zig wayland wayland-protocols mesa libglvnd stb libpulse
zig build
zig build run
```

## Configuration

`~/.config/hypr/hyprglaze.toml`:

```toml
# Effects: particles, windowglow, cellbloom, concentric, fluid, starfield,
#          visualizer, milkdrop, glitch, buddy, ai-buddy, tide, fire, swarm,
#          voltaic, moire, fable, ivy, whorl, weft
effect = "fluid"
theme = "Rosé Pine"

[transition]
duration = 0.25

# Workspace switches slide the effect field, mirroring Hyprland's own
# workspace animation (direction, duration, and easing are detected from
# `hyprctl animations` at startup and on config reload). Overrides:
# workspace_slide = "auto"      # auto | horizontal | vertical | none
# workspace_duration = 0.0      # seconds; 0 = auto (bezier easing only)
# workspace_spring = ""         # "mass,stiffness,dampening" (Hyprland does
#                               # not expose spring parameters over IPC, so a
#                               # custom hl.curve spring must be mirrored here)

[cursor]
smoothing = 0.85

[geometry]
smoothing = 0.85

[particles]
count = 60
damping = 0.999
pop_threshold = 50

[buddy]
scale = 2.0
sprite = "sprites/buddy.png"
ai_cooldown = 5.0
max_calls_per_minute = 6

[tide]
start_hour = 6.0      # hour at which the tide is empty
end_hour   = 24.0     # hour at which the tide is full

[voltaic]
arc_rate = 1.0        # ambient strike frequency multiplier
# sink = "..."        # PulseAudio monitor source (auto-detected by default)

[moire]
count = 60            # wave sources / orbiting bodies (max 60)

```

### CLI

```
hyprglaze --effect fire --theme "Rosé Pine"
hyprglaze --list-effects          # list available effects
hyprglaze --list-themes           # list available themes
hyprglaze --set-theme "Nord"      # persist a theme to the config file (hot-reloads)
hyprglaze --help                  # full flag reference
```

From source: substitute `zig build run --` for `hyprglaze`.

### Audio effects

Effects that react to sound (visualizer, milkdrop, starfield, and others marked audio-reactive above) capture system audio via PipeWire/PulseAudio. The output monitor is auto-detected. To use a different sink:

```toml
[visualizer]
sink = "alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo"
```

List available sinks with `pactl list short sinks`.

### AI buddy (AWS Bedrock)

The `ai-buddy` effect uses Claude Haiku via AWS Bedrock for decision-making. Create `~/.config/hypr/hyprglaze-aws.env`:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

Requires the `aws` CLI and model access enabled for `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` in Bedrock.

## How it talks to Hyprland

Most Hyprland companions poll the IPC socket for state. hyprglaze instead installs `src/core/watcher.lua` into the compositor's Lua VM at startup (and again after every config reload, which recreates that VM). The watcher runs a 16ms timer inside Hyprland, reads cursor and window state directly from compositor memory, and emits compact `custom>>hg:*` events on the socket2 event stream, but only when something actually changed.

The daemon holds a single socket2 connection and receives everything as push: cursor moves, window geometry (including mid-drag, which Hyprland otherwise never reports), and a heartbeat. If the heartbeat stops, the daemon reinstalls the watcher automatically. Steady state with nothing moving is zero IPC traffic and zero wakeups on the Hyprland side beyond the timer tick.

`zig build ipc-test` runs a standalone diagnostic that installs the watcher and prints the pushed state live.

## Shader Uniforms

| Uniform | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `iResolution` | `vec3` | Surface dimensions |
| `iTime` | `float` | Seconds since start |
| `iMouse` | `vec4` | Cursor position (smoothed) |
| `iWindow` | `vec4` | Focused window rect (smoothed) |
| `iWindows[32]` | `vec4[]` | All visible window rects (during a workspace switch: incoming and outgoing sets composed, sliding) |
| `iWindowCount` | `int` | Number of visible windows |
| `iFocusedIndex` | `int` | Index of the focused window in `iWindows` (-1 if none) |
| `iPrevIndex` | `int` | Index of the previously focused window in `iWindows` |
| `iTransition` | `float` | Focus change progress 0 to 1 (newly focused) |
| `iPalette[16]` | `vec3[]` | Theme color ramp |
| `iPaletteSize` | `int` | Number of palette colors |
| `iPaletteBg/Fg` | `vec3` | Theme background/foreground |
| `iParticles[300]` | `vec4[]` | Effect data (particles, trails, buddy state) |
| `iParticleCount` | `int` | Number of active entries |
| `iSprite` | `sampler2D` | Sprite sheet texture / FBO feedback |

## Adding an Effect

1. Create `src/effects/myeffect.zig` with a `pub const Context` struct (or a directory for complex effects)
2. Implement `init()`, `update(state)`, `upload(shader)`, `deinit()`
3. Register in `src/effects.zig`: add import, tagged union variant, init branch, and default shader path
4. Add a default shader at `shaders/myeffect.frag`
5. Configure via a `[myeffect]` section in TOML, read params with `config_mod.EffectParams`

New effects are picked up by `--list-effects` automatically via comptime reflection on the `Effect` union.
